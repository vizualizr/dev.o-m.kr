			- Functionally, Skills occupy a unique middle ground between "Rules" (passive, always-on guardrails) and "Workflows" (active, user-triggered macros). Unlike workflows that require specific commands (e.g., /test), Skills are agent-triggered: the model automatically detects the user's intent and dynamically equips the specific expertise required. This architecture allows for powerful composability; for example, a global Rule can enforce the use of a "Safe-Migration" Skill during database changes, or a single Workflow can orchestrate multiple Skills to build a robust deployment pipeline.
