- ## Summary
	- Documenting the design system of [[o-m.kr]]
- ## Steps
	- ### considerations
		- #### Key concepts
			- dot:
				- Everything that exist alone together
			- line:
				- The place where dots and line plays on.
			- plane:
				- The place where dots and line plays on.
	- ### confirmations
		- From [Material design system](https://m3.material.io/) by Google
			- Implementation of [[design tokens]] [link](https://m3.material.io/foundations/design-tokens/overview#6a0933c0-50f5-4dd6-b055-b7c4ff2c1535)

				- > “STAAT /Random l-XI” ([Rendgen, 2020, p. 300](zotero://select/library/items/VPCLWFFR)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/B956VGQY?page=304&annotation=7SFY3IBI))  복잡성 그대로를 있는 그대로 제시해야 하는가? 혹은 가시화를 위한 기본 논리가 개입해 복잡성을 줄여야 하는가?
				- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
				  Render complexity, then reveal the interaction.
				  #+END_IMPORTANT
					- Conflict is complex.
					- Present the complexity as it is seen in a glance.
						- Well visualized, the complexity must be beautiful and attractive as the pattern on the surface implies certain rules in
					- User's scrolling is an intention to dive into the presented complexity.
					- Thus complexity is an attractor.
					- Complexity is the result of iterated interaction between the relevant bodies.
				- If it is beautiful, it is an artwork.
	- ### Benchmarks
		- Look for information visualization projects by the Swiss design agencies.
