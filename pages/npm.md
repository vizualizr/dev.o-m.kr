- ### building and testing
	- You can use the same commands that you use locally to build and test your code. For example, if you run `npm run build` to run build steps defined in your `package.json` file and `npm test` to run your test suite, you would add those commands in your workflow file. ([source](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/use-cases-and-examples/building-and-testing/building-and-testing-nodejs#building-and-testing-your-code))
